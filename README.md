# DM-Test

The DMtest function implements the Diebold-Mariano (DM) test, a statistical procedure used to compare the predictive accuracy of two competing forecasts. Given actual values (y) and two forecast vectors (f1 and f2), the function computes a loss differential series (d) based on either squared error loss (default) or absolute error loss, depending on the useQuad flag. It then tests whether the mean of this loss differential is significantly different from zero using an OLS regression of d on a constant. The output, dm, is a test statistic that is asymptotically standard normal under the null hypothesis of equal predictive accuracy. If the user sets useNW to 1, the test adjusts for autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity using Newey-West robust standard errors. A positive dm value suggests that forecast f1 outperforms f2, making this function a practical tool for evaluating and comparing forecasting models in economics, finance, and time series applications.
